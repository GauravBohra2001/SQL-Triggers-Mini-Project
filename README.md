# SQL Triggers Mini Project

This mini project showcases the use of SQL triggers for auditing changes in an employee database. The project includes the following components:

1. **Database Setup:** The project starts by selecting the database and creating a master employee table to store employee information. It also creates a table for auditing employee data changes.

2. **After Insert Trigger:** An "after insert" trigger is implemented to log newly inserted records in the employee_audit table.

3. **After Delete Trigger:** An "after delete" trigger is used to log deleted records in the employee_audit table.

4. **After Update Trigger:** An "after update" trigger tracks changes to employee records and logs them in the employee_audit table.
